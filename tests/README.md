# Tests

This folder contains tests using terraform's conditions. You should be able to run `terraform apply`. Another `terraform apply` should not change anything. `terraform destroy` should destroy any resource without a problem.

Tests in `main.tf` deploys possible combinations of the module and checks if the module did, what was expected. The keys of the used maps indicate the tested combination.

Tests for special cases are split into files with meaningful names and error messages.

Subfolders `fail_*` containing tests that are expected to fail with expected errors in the `README.md`.
